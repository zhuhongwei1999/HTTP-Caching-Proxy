Cache policy:
Please specify your cache policy (e.g. cache size, replacement policy, when to clean expired reponse):
    cache structure:
        Map: RequestHeader -> ResponseObject
    cache size: 
        20
    replacement policy: 
        When new request is finding an corresponding cached response but found it expired, 
        it will revalidate a new response from the server ans then replace the old expired one.
        Use LRU caching policy to do replacement.

External failure:
    a. Invalid request: The request will be checked by the respoonse returned by sending it to server by proxy.
       Responding 400 Bad Request to client.
    b. If it contacts the server and receives a	corrupted response, a 502 Bad Getway will be send in response to client.

Exception guarantees
    a. Server estabilishment: 
        Server is established through getaddrinfo, build socket, bind and listen, if any of these return values does not meet with expectation,
        error massage is shown and the program exit with failure.
    b. Message accepting and receiving:
        The proxy receives and send request and response by using recv and send, if error happens,
        error massage is shown and the program exit with failure.

//////////
1. When doing a GET requst for "http://httpbin.org/forms/post", it can occasionally obtain the whole pages.
   The reasons leading to this is ambiguous as it sometimes fail but sometimes success.
   Looking at the request after accessing this url, it can be sure that the request is properly made.
   However the response is not in full scale.
   Solution: Try using a while loop to receive the whole content.
             Compare the content length with the received length.
             Looking for "\r\n\r\n" indicating the ending.

2. How to test a GET request as so many advanced webpages only support https as CONNECT?
   The webpages developed in hw1 would be a great example test.
   Using a request generation tool : "httpbin.org".

3. Why there are so many un_recognized access to web pages when tesing https://youtube.com in foxfire browser?
   Those are related to the browser, which are automatically generated as requesting to CONNECT to a web page.

4. What if a user A is accessing cache to get a valid response while user B's request wants to modify that cache?
   It would lead to serious problems relating to race condition.
   This danger should be properly handled by a mutex lock to prevent the simutaneous write and read from the cache.

5. How to parse a response and make it a class with all the information well categorized?
   Make split function to put every element split by “delim” (delim can be “\r\n”, “ “), and put the splited elements in to vectors for later use.
   For this, first split by \r\n to get every line, and then split the first line by “ “, then the remaining lines as headers by spiting by “:”.
   This split lines end by “\r\n\r\n”, and following that is the body content.
